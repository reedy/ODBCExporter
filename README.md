# ODBCExporter
Fairly generic ODBC exporter to export all tables to CSV files from a given ODBC DSN.

It will dump everything in a folder called export at the point the software is run.

Includes password-less Sage ODBC DSN of "Dsn=SageLine50v20;uid=manager" which has been tested to work with Sage Instant Accounts 2014.
